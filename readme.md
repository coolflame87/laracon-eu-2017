# Laracon EU 2017 Talk
## BotMan - From Zero to Chatbot

This is the codebase for my Laracon EU 2017 talk.
All BotMan commands can be found at `routes/botman.php`.

If you want to set up the project for yourself, make sure to install the dummy API.ai pizza agent and place the API.ai token in your .env file.
